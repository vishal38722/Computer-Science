To run this program you have to first compile the server and client files and then run it

Here I have made two different folders for server and client for ease of understanding

We have two additional files "clientFile.txt" and "serverFile.txt"

clientFile.txt ---> used to transfer from client to server using "put" command
serverFile.txt ---> used to transfer from server to client using "get" command


---------------- Everything starts from here ----------------

    Commands for server file (ftpS.c)
        
        gcc ftpS.c -o server                  (compilation)
        ./server                              (execution)
        

    Commands for client file (ftpC.c)
    
        gcc ftpC.c -o client                  (compilation)
        ./client                              (execution)
