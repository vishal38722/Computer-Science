To run this program you have to first compile the server and client files and then run it

    Commands for server file (UDPserver.c)
        
        gcc UDPserver.c -o server         (compilation)
        ./server                            (execution)
        


    Commands for client file (UDPclient.c)
    
        gcc UDPclient.c -o client              (compilation)
        ./client                            (execution)
        
        
        
    client will ask for input. You have to provide an absolute path to any directory and server will provide you
    all the files and folders present in the provided directory

    For absolute path you can right click in any directory and go to properties

    e.g. - /home/vishal//Desktop
