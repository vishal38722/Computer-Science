To run this program you have to first compile the server and client files and then run it

    Commands for server file (server.c)
        
        gcc server.c -o server                  (compilation)
        ./server                                (execution)
        


    Commands for UDP client (udp_client.c)
    
        gcc udp_client.c -o udp_client          (compilation)
        ./udp_client                            (execution)
        
        
    Commands for TCP client (tcp_client.c)
    
        gcc tcp_client.c -o tcp_client          (compilation)
        ./tcp_client                            (execution)
        
        
        
     Both the clients will ask for input you have to give a string, server will respond whether the given string 
     is palindrome or not
     
     e.g. - i)  input given to client : 12345
                server response : Not a palindrome
            
            ii) input given to client : 12321
                server response : Palindrome
